# personal-website
Files of the personal website I decided to create for experience and for some quick fun.
This is basically just a small project I decided to pick up in my free time at college, hoping to gain a better understanding 
of some web development languages.

If you have any suggestions please feel free to get in touch or just make them on your own.
